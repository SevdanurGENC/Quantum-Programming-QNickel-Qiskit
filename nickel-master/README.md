# QWorld's Nickel
Welcome to QWorld's Nickel!


Nickel is QWorld's intermediate level tutorial on conventional quantum algorithms.

## Installation

Follow the instructions given in the [installation file](installation.pdf)!

**Using Binder:** _You may [launch Nickel in the cloud with binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/qworld%2Fnickel/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/content.ipynb) but **please be aware of that**_ 
- _each time a new session is created, which takes some time to be initiated, and all changes are lost when ending the session; and,_
- _the session might be terminated if a new tab is not opened within 10 minutes._

## Credits

Most of the <font style="color: #A9A9A9;"><b><i>Nickel</i></b></font> is prepared under the project QPool2019 [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019) in 2019-2020 and it is expected to have contributions from public as well. 

We would like to thank participants of the QSilver Revision Week organized in January 2021 and the participants of the QSilver Pilot Workshop organized in April 2021 for revising the material. We would like to thank Yasir Ölmez for his techincal help in finalizing the notebooks.


### Conventional Quantum Algorithms

This part is mostly developed collaboratively by <a href="https://qworld.net/qturkey/" target="_blank">QTurkey</a>. The contributors are Arda Ç?nar, Berat Yenilen, Cenk Tüysüz, <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozlem.salehi/" target="_blank">Dr. Özlem Salehi</a> ([IITiS PAN](https://iitis.pl/en/)), and Utku Birkan. Simon's Algorithm notebook is developed by Vishal Bapje and Kenneth Isamande and revised by <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozlem.salehi/" target="_blank">Dr. Özlem Salehi</a>. 

### Solving Max-Cut problem using Grover's Search

This section in prepared by [Dr. Adam Glos](https://iitis.pl/en/person/aglos) ([IITiS PAN](https://iitis.pl/en/), [QPoland](https://qworld.net/qpoland/)) and updated by <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozlem.salehi/" target="_blank">Dr. Özlem Salehi</a> and Dr. Abuzer Yakary?lmaz (<a href="https://qworld.net/qlatvia/" target="_blank">QLatvia</a>). We would like to thank Dr. Maksim Dimitrijev (<a href="http://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/qlatvia/" target="_blank">QLatvia</a>) for revising the materials.
